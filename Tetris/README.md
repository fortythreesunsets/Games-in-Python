The player completes lines by moving differently shaped pieces, which descend onto the playing field. 
The completed lines disappear and grant the player points. 
The speed of the falling pieces increases with each level, leaving the player with less time to think about the placement.
The game ends when the uncleared lines reach the top of the playing field. 

## Controls
Make the piece fall faster = Down arrow key

Rotate piece = Up arrow key

Choose placement of piece = Left and Right arrow keys
