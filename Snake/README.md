# SNAKE
Made in Python using Pygame and Tkinter following [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/5tvER0MT14s) by Tech with Tim

The player attempts to eat green squares by running into them with the head of the snake. 
Each square eaten makes the snake longer, so avoiding collision with the snake becomes progressively more difficult.
